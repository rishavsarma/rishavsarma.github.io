        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence
          processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes
          include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using
          the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or
          definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of
          AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

          Natural Language Processing (NLP): Our NLP capabilities allow for
          seamless communication with our system, as well as improved
          understanding of user input for more accurate responses. Machine
          Learning: Our machine learning models allow for continuous improvement
          and customization of our AI, based on user interactions and data.
          Computer Vision: Our computer vision capabilities enable our AI to
          process and understand visual information, such as images and videos.
          Robotics: We offer advanced robotics technology, including autonomous
          navigation and manipulation capabilities. Generative Models: Our
          generative models can create new content, such as text, images, and
          audio, based on given inputs. Recommender Systems: We employ
          sophisticated recommender systems to personalize and improve the user
          experience by suggesting relevant content or products. Knowledge
          Graphs: Our AI uses knowledge graphs to understand and navigate the
          vast amount of information available on the web, providing users with
          accurate and comprehensive answers to their queries. Explainable AI:
          Our models are designed to be interpretable and transparent, allowing
          us to explain the reasoning behind our AI's decisions.
